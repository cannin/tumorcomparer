### About Metabolograms
Metabolograms are a visual tool for exploring metabolic pathways using both gene expression and metabolite abundance data. Data on the left corresponds to changes in gene expression, and data on the right correponds to changes in metabolite abundances. The center circle corresponds to the average value of a gene expression/metabolite abundance changes, and the outer circle shows the individual change for each constituent of the pathway.
